# ## Introduction
# 
# A/B tests are very commonly performed by data analysts and data scientists. For this project, you will be working to understand the results of an A/B test run by an e-commerce website.  Your goal is to work through this notebook to help the company understand if they should:
# - Implement the new webpage, 
# - Keep the old webpage, or 
# - Perhaps run the experiment longer to make their decision.
# 
# 
# <a id='probability'></a>
# ## Part I - Probability
# 
# To get started, let's import our libraries.

# In[2]:


import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
import random
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
get_ipython().run_line_magic('matplotlib', 'inline')
#We are setting the seed to assure you get the same answers on quizzes as we set up
random.seed(42)


# ### ToDo 1.1
# Now, read in the `ab_data.csv` data. Store it in `df`. Below is the description of the data, there are a total of 5 columns:
# 
# <center>
# 
# |Data columns|Purpose|Valid values|
# | ------------- |:-------------| -----:|
# |user_id|Unique ID|Int64 values|
# |timestamp|Time stamp when the user visited the webpage|-|
# |group|In the current A/B experiment, the users are categorized into two broad groups. <br>The `control` group users are expected to be served with `old_page`; and `treatment` group users are matched with the `new_page`. <br>However, **some inaccurate rows** are present in the initial data, such as a `control` group user is matched with a `new_page`. |`['control', 'treatment']`|
# |landing_page|It denotes whether the user visited the old or new webpage.|`['old_page', 'new_page']`|
# |converted|It denotes whether the user decided to pay for the company's product. Here, `1` means yes, the user bought the product.|`[0, 1]`|
# </center>
# 
# 
# 
# **a.** Read in the dataset from the `ab_data.csv` file and take a look at the top few rows here:

# In[3]:


df = pd.read_csv('ab_data.csv')
df.head()


# **b.** Use the cell below to find the number of rows in the dataset.

# In[4]:


df.shape[0]


# **c.** The number of unique users in the dataset.

# In[5]:


df.user_id.nunique()


# **d.** The proportion of users converted.

# In[6]:


df.converted.mean()


# **e.** The number of times when the "group" is `treatment` but "landing_page" is not a `new_page`.

# In[7]:


df.query('group == "treatment" and landing_page != "new_page"').user_id.nunique()


# In[8]:


df.query('group == "control" and landing_page != "old_page"').user_id.nunique()


# **f.** Do any of the rows have missing values?

# In[9]:


df.isna().sum()[0]


# ### ToDo 1.2  
# In a particular row, the **group** and **landing_page** columns should have either of the following acceptable values:
# 
# |user_id| timestamp|group|landing_page|converted|
# |---|---|---|---|---|
# |XXXX|XXXX|`control`| `old_page`|X |
# |XXXX|XXXX|`treatment`|`new_page`|X |
# 
# 
# It means, the `control` group users should match with `old_page`; and `treatment` group users should matched with the `new_page`. 
# 
# However, for the rows where `treatment` does not match with `new_page` or `control` does not match with `old_page`, we cannot be sure if such rows truly received the new or old wepage.  
# 
# 
# **a.** Now create a new dataset that does not contain those misleading rows. Store your new dataframe in **df2**.

# In[10]:


# Remove the inaccurate rows, and store the result in a new dataframe df2
df2 = df.drop(df.query('group == "control" and landing_page != "old_page"').index);
df2 = df2.drop(df2.query('group == "treatment" and landing_page != "new_page"').index);
df2.shape[0]


# In[11]:


# Double Check all of the incorrect rows were removed from df2 - 
# Output of the statement below should be 0
df2[((df2['group'] == 'treatment') == (df2['landing_page'] == 'new_page')) == False].shape[0]


# ### ToDo 1.3  

# **a.** How many unique **user_id**s are in **df2**?

# In[12]:


df2.user_id.nunique()


# **b.** There is one **user_id** repeated in **df2**.  What is it?

# In[13]:


df2[df2['user_id'].duplicated()].user_id


# **c.** Display the rows for the duplicate **user_id**? 

# In[14]:


df2.query('user_id == 773192')


# **d.** Remove **one** of the rows with a duplicate **user_id**, from the **df2** dataframe.

# In[15]:


# Remove one of the rows with a duplicate user_id..
# Hint: The dataframe.drop_duplicates() may not work in this case because the rows with duplicate user_id are not entirely identical. 
df2.drop_duplicates(subset = ['user_id'], keep = 'last', inplace = True)
# Check again if the row with a duplicate user_id is deleted or not
df2.query('user_id == 773192')


# In[16]:


#Checking the removal of the duplicated user_id
df2.shape[0]


# ### ToDo 1.4  
# 
# **a.** What is the probability of an individual converting regardless of the page they receive?<br><br>
# 

# In[17]:


population_conversion = df2.converted.mean()
population_conversion


# **b.** Given that an individual was in the `control` group, what is the probability they converted?

# In[18]:


control_conversion = df2.query('group == "control"').converted.mean()
control_conversion


# **c.** Given that an individual was in the `treatment` group, what is the probability they converted?

# In[19]:


treatment_conversion = df2.query('group == "treatment"').converted.mean()
treatment_conversion


# In[20]:


# Calculate the actual difference (obs_diff) between the conversion rates for the two groups.
obs_diff = treatment_conversion - control_conversion
obs_diff


# **d.** What is the probability that an individual received the new page?

# In[21]:


df2[df2['landing_page'] == 'new_page'].count()[0]/df2.shape[0]


# **e.** Consider your results from parts (a) through (d) above, and explain below whether the new `treatment` group users lead to more conversions.

# "According to the conversion rates calculated for both control and treatment group we notice that the control group had slightly higher conversion rates which might suggest that the old_page might be better that the new_page."

# <a id='ab_test'></a>
# ## Part II - A/B Test
#   
# 
# ### ToDo 2.1
# Now, consider you need to make the decision just based on all the data provided.  
#  
# If you want to assume that the old page is better unless the new page proves to be definitely better at a Type I error rate of 5%, what should be your null and alternative hypotheses (**$H_0$** and **$H_1$**)?  
# 
# You can state your hypothesis in terms of words or in terms of **$p_{old}$** and **$p_{new}$**, which are the "converted" probability (or rate) for the old and new pages respectively.

#                                                 ùêª0: ùëùùëõùëíùë§ =< ùëùùëúùëôùëë
#                                                 ùêª1: ùëùùëõùëíùë§ > ùëùùëúùëôùëë

# ### ToDo 2.2 - Null Hypothesis $H_0$ Testing
# Under the null hypothesis $H_0$, assume that $p_{new}$ and $p_{old}$ are equal. Furthermore, assume that $p_{new}$ and $p_{old}$ both are equal to the **converted** success rate in the `df2` data regardless of the page. So, our assumption is: <br><br>
# <center>
# $p_{new}$ = $p_{old}$ = $p_{population}$
# </center>
# 
# In this section, you will: 
# 
# - Simulate (bootstrap) sample data set for both groups, and compute the  "converted" probability $p$ for those samples. 
# 
# 
# - Use a sample size for each group equal to the ones in the `df2` data.
# 
# 
# - Compute the difference in the "converted" probability for the two samples above. 
# 
# 
# - Perform the sampling distribution for the "difference in the converted probability" between the two simulated-samples over 10,000 iterations; and calculate an estimate.

# 
# **h. Sampling distribution** <br>
# Re-create `new_page_converted` and `old_page_converted` and find the $(p{'}_{new}$ - $p{'}_{old})$ value 10,000 times using the same simulation process you used in parts (a) through (g) above.

# Store all  $(p{'}_{new}$ - $p{'}_{old})$  values in a NumPy array called `p_diffs`.

for _ in range(10000):

# **k.** Please explain in words what you have just computed in part **j** above.  
#  - What is this value called in scientific studies?             
#  - What does this value signify in terms of whether or not there is a difference between the new and old pages?

# "The calculated value is called the 'p_value'."
# 
# "Comparing this value with type I error rate suggests that we fail to reject the null hypothesis since the p_value is larger than the type I error rate." 

# 
# 
# **l. Using Built-in Methods for Hypothesis Testing**<br>
# We could also use a built-in to achieve similar results.  Though using the built-in might be easier to code, the above portions are a walkthrough of the ideas that are critical to correctly thinking about statistical significance. 
# 
# Fill in the statements below to calculate the:
# - `convert_old`: number of conversions with the old_page
# - `convert_new`: number of conversions with the new_page
# - `n_old`: number of individuals who were shown the old_page
# - `n_new`: number of individuals who were shown the new_page
# 

# In[38]:


import statsmodels.api as sm

# number of conversions with the old_page
convert_old = df2.query('landing_page == "old_page" and converted == 1').count()[0];

# number of conversions with the new_page
convert_new = df2.query('landing_page == "new_page" and converted == 1').count()[0];

# number of individuals who were shown the old_page
n_old = df2.query('landing_page == "old_page"').count()[0];

# number of individuals who received new_page
n_new = df2.query('landing_page == "new_page"').count()[0];

convert_old, convert_new, n_old, n_new


# **m.** Now use `sm.stats.proportions_ztest()` to compute your test statistic and p-value.
#  
# The built-in function above will return the z_score, p_value. 
# 
# ---
# ### About the two-sample z-test
# Recall that you have plotted a distribution `p_diffs` representing the
# difference in the "converted" probability  $(p{'}_{new}-p{'}_{old})$  for your two simulated samples 10,000 times. 
#  
# Next step is to make a decision to reject or fail to reject the null hypothesis based on comparing these two values: 
# - $Z_{score}$
# - $Z_{\alpha}$ or $Z_{0.05}$, also known as critical value at 95% confidence interval.  $Z_{0.05}$ is 1.645 for one-tailed tests,  and 1.960 for two-tailed test. You can determine the $Z_{\alpha}$ from the z-table manually. 
# 
# Decide if your hypothesis is either a two-tailed, left-tailed, or right-tailed test. Accordingly, reject OR fail to reject the  null based on the comparison between $Z_{score}$ and $Z_{\alpha}$. We determine whether or not the $Z_{score}$ lies in the "rejection region" in the distribution. In other words, a "rejection region" is an interval where the null hypothesis is rejected iff the $Z_{score}$ lies in that region.
# 

# In[39]:


import statsmodels.api as sm
# ToDo: Complete the sm.stats.proportions_ztest() method arguments
z_score, p_value = sm.stats.proportions_ztest([convert_old, convert_new], [n_old, n_new], alternative= 'larger')
print(z_score, p_value)


# **n.** What do the z-score and p-value you computed in the previous question mean for the conversion rates of the old and new pages?  Do they agree with the findings in parts **j.** and **k.**?<br><br>
# 

# "Based on the z_score we calculated when we compare it to the critical value at 95% we find that the calculated z_score is smaller the the critical value for a right_tailed test which suggests that we fail to reject the null hypothesis, also when we compare the p_value to type I error rate we find that the p_value is larger than the type I error rate which also suggests the same as the z_score value."

# <a id='regression'></a>
# ### Part III - A regression approach
# 
# ### ToDo 3.1 
# In this final part, you will see that the result you achieved in the A/B test in Part II above can also be achieved by performing regression.<br><br> 
# 
# **a.** Since each row in the `df2` data is either a conversion or no conversion, what type of regression should you be performing in this case?

#  "logistic regression"

# **b.** The goal is to use **statsmodels** library to fit the regression model you specified in part **a.** above to see if there is a significant difference in conversion based on the page-type a customer receives. However, you first need to create the following two columns in the `df2` dataframe:
#  1. `intercept` - It should be `1` in the entire column. 
#  2. `ab_page` - It's a dummy variable column, having a value `1` when an individual receives the **treatment**, otherwise `0`.  

# In[40]:


df2['intercept'] = 1
df2[['a_page', 'ab_page']] = pd.get_dummies(df2['group'])
df2.head()


# **c.** Use **statsmodels** to instantiate your regression model on the two columns you created in part (b). above, then fit the model to predict whether or not an individual converts. 
# 

# In[41]:


log_mod = sm.Logit(df2['converted'], df2[['intercept', 'ab_page']])
result = log_mod.fit()


# **d.** Provide the summary of your model below, and use it as necessary to answer the following questions.

# In[42]:


result.summary2()


# In[43]:


#exponentiating the coefficients values and taking the reciprocal of the values
1/np.exp(result.params)


# **e.** What is the p-value associated with **ab_page**? Why does it differ from the value you found in **Part II**?<br><br>  
# 

# "The model here suggests that the null hypothesis states that new_page is less than or equal to old_page in terms of conversion rates and the alternative hypothesis suggests that new_page is higher than old_page in terms of conversion rates.
# Comparing the p_value of ab_page to type I error rate suggests that conversion rates according to ab_page are statistically significant and we fail to reject the null hypothesis, but practically it does not make much of a difference."

# **f.** Now, you are considering other things that might influence whether or not an individual converts.  Discuss why it is a good idea to consider other factors to add into your regression model.  Are there any disadvantages to adding additional terms into your regression model?

# "Here when we compared the conversion rates based on old_page and new_page we found that there was a minor difference between the two pages which might appear statistically significant but practically it may not have much of a difference, so it was important to see if there might be other factors that might affect the conversion rates."

# **g. Adding countries**<br> 
# Now along with testing if the conversion rate changes for different pages, also add an effect based on which country a user lives in. 
# 
# 1. You will need to read in the **countries.csv** dataset and merge together your `df2` datasets on the appropriate rows. You call the resulting dataframe `df_merged`. 
# 
# 2. Does it appear that country had an impact on conversion?  To answer this question, consider the three unique values, `['UK', 'US', 'CA']`, in the `country` column. Create dummy variables for these country columns. 
# 
#  Provide the statistical output as well as a written response to answer this question.

# In[44]:


# Read the countries.csv
countries_df = pd.read_csv('countries.csv')
countries_df.head()


# In[45]:


# Join with the df2 dataframe
df_merged = df2.set_index('user_id').join(countries_df.set_index('user_id'))
df_merged.head()


# In[52]:


# Create the necessary dummy variables
df_merged[['CA', 'UK', 'US']] = pd.get_dummies(df_merged['country'])
df_merged.head(10)


# **h. Fit your model and obtain the results**<br> 
# Though you have now looked at the individual factors of country and page on conversion, we would now like to look at an interaction between page and country to see if are there significant effects on conversion.  **Create the necessary additional columns, and fit the new model.** 
# 

# In[53]:


# Fit your model, and summarize the results
log_mod_coun = sm.Logit(df_merged['converted'], df_merged[['intercept', 'ab_page', 'US', 'UK']])
result_coun = log_mod_coun.fit()
result_coun.summary2()


# In[54]:


1/np.exp(result_coun.params)


# "When we compare the p_value of our variables to the type I error rate we find that they are larger than the error rate which suggests that our variables are statistically significant and hence we fail to reject the null hypothesis. But practically we also find that the country variable has less impact on the conversion rate."
